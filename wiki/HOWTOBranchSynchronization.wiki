=Steps=
  # Switch to a working copy of the branch in which you want to receive the changes
  # Commit all the modification in the branch. There must be no pending modification.
  # Left click on the project -> Team -> Merge
  # In the Dialog:
    * In the *From:* field enter the full folder URL of the trunk. This depends on the platform (Java, Android, Eclipse or .NET).
    * In the *From Revision* field, enter the revision number of the creation of the branch.
    For example:
    {{{
Rev Comments
39. Working on MyBranch 
38. Working on trunk 
37. Working on MyBranch 
36. Create branch MyBranch 
35. Working on trunk 
34. Working on trunk 
...
}}}
    In this case, if you want to port the changes made to the trunk into the MyBranch branch, you have to select the revision 36.
    * Check the option *Use "From:" URL*
    * Check the option *Merge to HEAD revision*
    * Click on *Merge*
