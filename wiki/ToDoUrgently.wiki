#summary Things (bugfixes and similar) to be done urgently

= Introduction =

This page describes the top priority issues to be dealt with.

1) BUG when handling goal conjuction in parentheses.

2) SERIOUS PERFORMANCE ISSUE in large projects making large use of lists.

1) BUG when handling goal conjuction in parentheses:
                     (g1,g2),(g3,g4)  
   returns true even if (g3,g4) fails, provided that (g1,g2) 
   is true.
   Current workaround is adding a cut, e.g. (g1,g2,!),(g3,g4)
   but clearly this is not a good solution.

2) A problem that is solved by SWI-prolog nearly in real time requires more than *an hour* with tuProlog. Code profiling 
   showed that the method Struct.isList() consumes more than 
   90% of the time, and gets called extremely often.
   Tentative caching strategy: trying to cache the return 
   value the first time it gets calculated, the overall time 
   consumption reduced by more than 90% but the results look 
   incorrect, too (as expected since the class is not immutable).

   Deserves going in depth.
