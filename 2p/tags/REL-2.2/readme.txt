tuProlog 2.2
============

This version of tuProlog adds support for ISO Prolog exceptions.
Please refer to the enclosed PDF document for further information on this topic.

Over 193 test were successfully run to extensively test this improvement: 
tuProlog behaviour proved identical, in all test cases, both with expected
standards and some references widely-adopted implementations (SWI Prolog,
Sicstus Prolog). 

In addition, tuProlog 2.2 provides two further, tuProlog-specific predicates 
to handle in Prolog exceptions raised in the Java world via JavaLibrary, so 
as to provide support for exception handling also in the context of 
multi-paradigm programming.
